## Data Processing 
1. Duplicates were removed
2. Replaced column values of Marital status and Gender for a better understanding 
 Marital status : M/S = Married / Single

 Gender : M/F = Male / Female

4.  A New column was created "Age Brackets" in which ages were grouped for better visualization.

    < 31 is Adolescent , >=31 & < 51 is Middle Aged , >51 is Old.
